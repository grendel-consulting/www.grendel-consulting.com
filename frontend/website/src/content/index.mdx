Early-stage businesses and enterprises often require a helping hand navigating all-too common challenges: 

- Setting and driving technical direction
- Retaining agility in the face of security and compliance pressures
- Shifting between maturities and growth stages whilst keeping pace with delivery or service pressures. 
- Making tough choices in prioritisation

Typically these kind of problems require a rare blend of people, process and technology skills found in a <dfn id="cto">Chief Technology Officer</dfn> (<abbr>CTO</abbr>), Head of Engineering, or Engineering Director - or in a <dfn id="ciso">Chief Information Security Officer</dfn> (<abbr>CISO</abbr>) or Head of Information Security.

Typically these are hard to find, hard to hire, or hard to justify types of people.

This is where a Fractional, Virtual or Interim comes in.

This is where I come in.
