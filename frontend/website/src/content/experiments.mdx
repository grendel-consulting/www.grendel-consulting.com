I remain hands-on in both engineering and security, exploring interests such as: where product, people, processes and technology meet; data ingestion, lineage and contracts; how micro-scale and startup business can operate at enterprise scale whilst remaining nimble; and, what the intersection between engineering and security is.

## Control Tower

I operate an AWS Organisation with ~20 member accounts, using [AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/) and the Account Factory for Terraform stack; this is built on a combination of CloudFormation, Terraform (including Terraform Cloud), CodePipeline and GitHub Actions.

## Learner Engagement

I have been collaborating with <span className="h-card">[Path Dependence](https://www.pathdependence.co.uk/)</span> in exploring where interactive 'play' leads to better outcomes in learning, specifically relating to cybersecurity awareness and related concepts through interactive fiction, games and similar modes.

## Cloud Compliance

I have crafted a collection of [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io/) flows and [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/) queries (and some other related serverless plumbing) to inspect and monitor my AWS cloud estate, together with some of our critical SaaS tools. I have been exploring a micro-SaaS offering in this space, focused on startups and small businesses.

## Website(s)

I built this website, to explore separations of content and code, design systems, and infrastructure as applications. Dig in a bit more in our <Link to="/colophon">Colophon</Link>.
