We are committed to ensuring a perceivable, operable, understandable and robust website for our visitors and customers; this Accessibility Statement applies to our website, run by <Business.LegalName/> and accessible at <Business.Website/>. We've started by trying to ensure that our website content is clearly presented, well structured, clutter free and written with minimal jargon.

## Your Experience

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* Read all text without needing to change colours or fonts
* But still be able to change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
* Zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
* Navigate most of the website using a keyboard
* Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Compliance With Guideliness

We aim to ensure this website is fully compliant with the [<dfn id="wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</dfn> (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>), version 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standard.

We test compliance using both automated tools, such as [Pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview), and manual verification.
