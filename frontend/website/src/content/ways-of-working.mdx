## Starting Out

All of my engagements begin with an <Business.Contact.Bookings>exploratory chat</Business.Contact.Bookings>, free of charge and with no obligation, to see where I can help you and what that might look like. I recommend preparing a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) beforehand, or I can provide one, so that our conversation can be as frank and open as possible.

I'm based in Edinburgh, so typically these starting conversations would be remote via a video-call, but I'm happy to meet in person if we're in a reasonable proximity.

By the end of this initial meeting, we should both be in a position to agree to work together - how I might help you and your business, what that might look like, and the scope and responsibilities of the work involved - or not, if it doesn't make sense to do so. If so, I would prepare a contract and schedule of work.

## Your "As-A-Service" Engagement

Depending on your needs and where I can help, I can potentially engage in a broad spectrum of ways: remote or hybrid; embedded with your team or as a external lever; in flavours of part-time from retainer to hourly through to full-time interim or fixed-term; async in your channels and tools, or synchronous and face-to-face.

## Finishing Off

Generally our work together will start with an exit in mind, whether that is a specific deliverable or a milestone that means you have what you need. We will collectively define what this looks like, how to know when we've reached that stage, and what comes afterwards.

## Start Now

If you think I can help your business succeed, please reach out to <Business.Contact.Reception/> or <Business.Contact.Bookings>book some time</Business.Contact.Bookings> for an exploratory chat
