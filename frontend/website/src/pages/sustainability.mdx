At <BusinessLegalName/> we're moving towards the Triple Bottom Line concept for measuring business success and sustainability. We're early on formalising this journey - and not perfect - but it is something that we take seriously. We have started to implement a range of environmental, social and economic strategies to enable us to minimise and reduce our negative impact.

## Environmental

- We work remotely, where possible, and minimise travel otherwise
- We have begun to measure the carbon cost of our operations; this website costs ~0.01g of <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">CO2</abbr> per page view
- We are exploring carbon syncing, that is ensuring we offset our carbon footprint at a faster or equivalent rate than we emit it
- We work digitally, minimising printing, stationary and other consumables

## Social

- We work flexibly and communicate respectfully
- We encourage feedback from customers and prospects, embracing self-reflection and learning
- We work justly and are exploring the [Good Business Charter](https://goodbusinesscharter.com/accreditation-small-organisations/) to reflect this
- We mentor engineers early in their careers, or moving into positions of increased authority

## Economic

- We keep costs low through technology choices and virtual operation of the business
- We avoid ethical liabilities by implementing our social and environmental sustainability policies.
- We minimise debt and other financial liabilities
- We keep things simple and efficient
