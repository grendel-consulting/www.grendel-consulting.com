I'm a strong believer in augmentation; the reality of the '10x engineer' is most often the one who makes the rest of the team move a little bit faster every day. I often recommend folks engage me centred on the bits of their business where I can help everyone else move faster, with less friction, and with better and more predicatable results. You should pay for the bits of that engagement you consume, just as you do in the cloud or other 'as-a-service' providers.

If you think I can help your business succeed, please <BusinessContactBookings>book some time</BusinessContactBookings> for an exploratory chat, or reach out to me at <BusinessContactReception/>

## Leadership, Delivery and Implementation

I work with Executives and Boards in funded startups and scale-ups, or those in leadership positions in enterprise - leveraging 25+ years of financial services, fintech, security and data management experience - in strategy and roadmaps, transformation, prioritisation, decision-making, problem-solving; and in building, motivating and repairing diverse teams.

I have experience working inside technology teams as well as consulting to them, to help improve their product, process, people and technology, in roles such as:

- Interim-, or Virtual-, <abbr title="Chief Technology Officer">CTO</abbr> or <abbr title="Chief Information Security Officer">CISO</abbr> (sometimes called a Fractional CTO or CISO)
- DevOps, Cloud and Security Consulting
- Process Optimisation and Toolsmithing, including CICD and Infrastructure-as-Code
- Proof-of-Concept and Innovation Consulting
- CTO Mentoring

I can provide support to an existing CxO, engineering leader, or Board; an outside voice and sounding board, on a retained or hourly basis, if a more explicit delivery or consulting role isn't the right fit.

## Due Diligence and Compliance

I can help with vetting vendors, or preparing to be vetted by prospective customers, acquirers, or investors; if you're an potential investor or newly-in-seat executive, I can help you navigate the technology and engineering, understand the 'ground truth', and recommend where you might want to focus your energies or invesment.

I have implemented <abbr lang="en-US" title="International Organization for Standardization standard for Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection">ISO 27001:2022</abbr> (and 2013) and <abbr lang="en-US" title="System and Organization Controls report on Trust Services Criteria">SOC 2 Type II</abbr> in previous roles, and are happy to help you define, plan or prepare for these.

## Mentoring

I offer _pro bono_ mentoring to high-potential engineers and leaders, no more than three at any one time; over the past five years my mentees have typically been engineering leaders exploring their first CTO role or wishing to make the move to one. At the moment I am prioritising underrepresented groups and those affected by tech layoffs.

If I cannot offer mentoring, I can put you in touch with communities that facilitate such introductions.
