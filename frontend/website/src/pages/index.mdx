Early-stage businesses and enterprises often require a helping hand navigating all-too common challenges:

- Setting and driving technical direction
- Retaining agility in the face of security and compliance pressures
- Shifting between maturities and growth stages whilst keeping pace with delivery or service pressures.
- Making tough choices in prioritisation

Typically, these kinds of problems require a rare blend of people, process and technology skills found in a <dfn id="cto">Chief Technology Officer</dfn> (<abbr>CTO</abbr>), Head of Engineering, or Engineering Director - or in a <dfn id="ciso">Chief Information Security Officer</dfn> (<abbr>CISO</abbr>) or Head of Information Security.

Typically these are hard to find, hard to hire, or hard to justify types of people.

This is where a Fractional, Virtual or Interim comes in.

This is where I come in.

<BusinessLegalName /> is operated by me - <PrincipalFullName />, an Engineering
and Security Leader with over 25 years of experience in the Financial Services,
FinTech and Data Management sectors, where I have built a reputation for
engineering excellence, innovation, and pragmatism. I have successfully led
multiple early-stage businesses through their security and compliance journeys,
rescued failing teams and initiatives in large enterprise, and built nimble and
robust delivery capabilities into both. These engagements can range from
micro-engagements on strategy, transformation and technology introduction, to
proof of concept work on data products and data lakehouses, to multi-month
interim CTO roles.

I can help your business succeed. Reach out to <BusinessContactReception/> or <BusinessContactBookings>book some time</BusinessContactBookings> for an exploratory chat.
